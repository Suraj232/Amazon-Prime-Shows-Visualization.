Upon selecting a movie, the dashboard dynamically showcases comprehensive details such as the release year, duration, cast, movie/show description, and genre. This user-friendly feature facilitates a seamless exploration of the content library, providing a holistic view of each selected title.

To foster continuous improvement, I invite comments from users to identify areas where enhancement can be made. This collaborative approach ensures that the visualization remains intuitive, informative, and aligned with user expectations.
